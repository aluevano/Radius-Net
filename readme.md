# Looking for someone to maintain this project

Hi, I'm looking for someone to take over this project as I no longer have time to dedicate to it.

If you would like to do so, please contact me via an issue, make a fork and do your first change.
I can help you set up the CI and indicate on this README who is maintaining the project (name & url).

-------------------------------------------------------------

This is a fork from Radius-net from https://code.google.com/archive/p/radius-net/

Here are the main differences:
* VS 2015 project
* .Net 4.5
* has a signed nuget package https://www.nuget.org/packages/Radius-Net/
* CI with appveyor [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/9du4gkbyt0e848yj?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/tomap/radius-net)
* bump version to 2.0
* introduces a fix related to UDP
